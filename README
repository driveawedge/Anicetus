h1. Build Instructions

Each component is built with Maven. Unfortunately building the Flume adapter does require special
steps due to Thrift and Flume not being in the Maven repository.

h2. Thrift

First download the Thrift from Apache - http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/download/

Unpack the archive and follow the directions for building Thrift.

Finally install libthrift.jar from the directory lib/java after your build finishes into your
maven repository.
